# Building
## CMake (Preferred)
Build using cmake with the following commands for Windows & Linux. Linux requires the SFML dependencies (listed below) to be installed to build it from source.

Windows only requires git and cmake to be installed prior to building.

From the top level directory:

```sh
   cmake -B build
   cmake --build build
```
This will create a statically linked binary `life.exe` in `build/bin/`

## Linux dependencies for static build
These libraries are required for building SFML from source through cmake, and statically linking the libraries if building manually.

- libEGL_mesa
- libfreetype
- libudev
- libX11
- libXcursor
